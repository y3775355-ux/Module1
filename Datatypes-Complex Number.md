# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads the real and imaginary parts from the user and prints the corresponding complex number.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1.Start

2.Read an integer value from the user and store it in variable a (real part).

3.Read another integer value from the user and store it in variable b (imaginary part).

4.Create a complex number using the built-in complex() function:

        c = complex(a, b)
        
5.Display the complex number c.

6.End



## 💻 Program
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=complex(a,b)
print(c)
```


## Output

## Result
The program correctly prints the complex number formed by the given inputs.
