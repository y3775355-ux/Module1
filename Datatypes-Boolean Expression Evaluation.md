# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
2. Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
3. Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
4. Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
5. Print the value of a with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of b with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of c with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of d with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
```
a=(0==True)
b=(False==False)
c=True+True
d=False+9
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")
print(f"c: {c}")
print(f"d: {d}")

```
## Output

## Result
Thus, to write a python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False is compiled and the output is verifiedÂ successfully.
